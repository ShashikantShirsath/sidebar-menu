# Sidebar-Menu
created project using HTML & CSS
where utilized CSS properties such as transition, transform, overflow, shadow, opacity & etc.
I used checkbox with 'checked' pscudo class which enables to perform some work on state 'checked' and on state 'unchecked'. so using this property i developed a responsive side menubar which hides itself on click and show menu on click.
